## Agile vs DevOps
---
As a DevOps Engineer, interview questions like this are quite expected. Start by describing the obvious overlap between DevOps and Agile. Although the implementation of DevOps is always in sync with Agile methodologies, there is a clear difference between the two. The principles of Agile are associated with seamless production or development of a piece of software. On the other hand, DevOps deals with the development, followed by deployment of the software, ensuring faster turnaround time, minimum errors, and reliability.

## Fundamental differences between DevOps & Agile
---
Although DevOps shares some similarities with the Agile methodology, which is one of the most popular SDLC methodologies, both are fundamentally different approaches to software development. Following are the various fundamental differences between the two:

- Agile Approach – The agile approach is only meant for development in Agile while the DevOps approach is meant for both development and operations in DevOps.
- Practices and Processes – While agile involves practices such as Agile Scrum and Agile Kanban, DevOps involves processes such as CD (Continuous Delivery), CI (Continuous Integration), and CT (Continuous Testing).
- Priority – Agile prioritizes timeliness whereas, DevOps gives equal priority to timeliness and quality.
- Release Cycles – DevOps offers smaller release cycles with immediate feedback while Agile offers only smaller release cycles without immediate feedback.
- Feedback Source – Agile relies on feedback from customers while feedback from self (monitoring tools) is involved in DevOps.
- Scope of Work – For Agile, the scope of work is agility only but for DevOps, it is agility and the need for automation.
