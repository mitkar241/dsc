## What Do You Know about DevOps?
---
Your answer must be simple and straightforward. Begin by explaining the growing importance of DevOps in the IT industry. Discuss how such an approach aims to synergize the efforts of the development and operations teams to accelerate the delivery of software products, with a minimal failure rate. Include how DevOps is a value-added practice, where development and operations engineers join hands throughout the product or service lifecycle, right from the design stage to the point of deployment.

## Why do we need DevOps
---
Organizations these days are trying to transport small features to customers via a series of release trains instead of releasing big feature sets. There are several benefits of doing so, including better software quality and quick customer feedback.

- All such benefits lead to a higher level of customer satisfaction, which is the most important goal for any product development project. To do so, companies need to:
  - Increase deployment frequency
  - Lessen lead time between fixes
  - Lower failure rate of new releases
  - In case of new release crashing, have a faster mean time to recovery
- DevOps helps in fulfilling all these requirements and thus, achieving seamless software delivery. Full-fledged organizations like Amazon, Etsy, and Google have adopted DevOps methodology resulting in achieving performance levels that were previously uncharted.
- With the adoption of DevOps methodology, organizations are able to accomplish tens to thousands of deployments in a single day. Moreover, doing so while offering first-rate reliability, security, and stability.

## Important business and technical benefits of using DevOps
---
DevOps brings a lot of business and technical benefits to the table. Some of the most important ones are listed down as follows:

- Business benefits:
  - Enhanced operating environment stability
  - Faster delivery of features
  - More time for adding value to the product
- Technical benefits:
  - Continuous software delivery
  - Faster problem resolution
  - Lesser complex problems

## Major benefits of implementing DevOps automation
---
Following are the major benefits of implementing DevOps automation:

- Removal of the possibility of human error from the CD equation (Core benefit)
- As tasks become more predictable and repeatable, it is easy to identify and correct when something goes wrong. Hence, it results in producing more reliable and robust systems
- Removes bottlenecks from the CI pipeline. It results in increased deployment frequency and decreased number of failed deployments. Both of them are important DevOps KPIs

## Why Has DevOps Gained Prominence over the Last Few Years?
---
- Before talking about the growing popularity of DevOps, discuss the current industry scenario. Begin with some examples of how big players such as Netflix and Facebook are investing in DevOps to automate and accelerate application deployment and how this has helped them grow their business. Using Facebook as an example, you would point to Facebook’s continuous deployment and code ownership models and how these have helped it scale up but ensure the quality of experience at the same time. Hundreds of lines of code are implemented without affecting quality, stability, and security.
- Your next use case should be Netflix. This streaming and on-demand video company follow similar practices with fully automated processes and systems. Mention the user base of these two organizations: Facebook has 2 billion users while Netflix streams online content to more than 100 million users worldwide.
- These are great examples of how DevOps can help organizations to ensure higher success rates for releases, reduce the lead time between bug fixes, streamline and continuous delivery through automation, and an overall reduction in manpower costs.

## Please explain the core operations of DevOps in terms of development and infrastructure.
---
Core operations of DevOps in terms of development and infrastructure are:

- Application development – Developing a product that is able to meet all customer requirements and offers a remarkable level of quality
- Code coverage – Measurement of the total number of blocks or lines or arcs of the code executed while the automated tests are running
- Code developing – Prepare the code base required for the product development
- Configuration – Allowing the product to be used in an optimum way
- Deployment – Installing the software to be used by the end-user
- Orchestration – Arrangement of several automated tasks
- Packaging – Activities involved when the release is ready for deployment
- Provisioning – Ensuring that the infrastructure changes arrive just-in-time with the code that requires it
- Unit testing – Meant for testing individual units or components

## KPIs used to gauge DevOps success
---
KPIs is a contracted form of Key Performance Indicators. In order to measure the success of a DevOps process, several KPIs can be used. Some of the most popular ones are:

- Application performance
- Application usage and traffic
- The automated test pass percentage
- Availability
- Change volume
- Customer tickets
- Defect escape rate
- Deployment frequency
- Deployment time
- Error rates
- Failed deployments
- Lead time
- Meantime to detection (MTTD)
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## Popular DevOps tools
---
Following is a list of some of the most widely used DevOps tools:

- Ansible – A configuration management and application deployment tool
- Chef – A configuration management and application deployment tool
- Docker – A containerization tool
- Git – A version control system (VCS) tool
- Jenkins – A continuous integration (CI) tool
- Jira – An agile team collaboration tool
- Nagios – A continuous monitoring tool
- Puppet – A configuration management and application deployment tool
- Selenium – A continuous testing (CT) tool

## Which Are Some of the Most Popular DevOps Tools? Do You Have Experience Working with Any of These Tools?
---
The more popular DevOps tools include:
- Selenium
- Puppet
- Chef
- Git
- Jenkins
- Ansible
- Docker

## Do You Want to Master All These Devops Tools?
---
Thoroughly describe any tools that you are confident about, what it’s abilities are and why you prefer using it. For example, if you have expertise in Git, you would tell the interviewer that Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) tool that allows the user to track file changes and revert to specific changes when required. Discuss how Git’s distributed architecture gives it an added edge where developers make changes locally and can have the entire project history on their local Git repositories, which can be later shared with other team members.
