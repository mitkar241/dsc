# Config Management
---

## Why Are Configuration Management Processes and Tools Important?
---
Talk about multiple software builds, releases, revisions, and versions for each software or testware that is being developed. Move on to explain the need for storing and maintaining data, keeping track of development builds and simplified troubleshooting. Donâ€™t forget to mention the key CM tools that can be used to achieve these objectives. Talk about how tools like Puppet, Ansible, and Chef help in automating software deployment and configuration on several servers.

## How Would You Explain the Concept of `Infrastructure as Code`(IaC)?
---
It is a good idea to talk about IaC as a concept, which is sometimes referred to as a programmable infrastructure, where infrastructure is perceived in the same way as any other code. Describe how the traditional approach to managing infrastructure is taking a back seat and how manual configurations, obsolete tools, and custom scripts are becoming less reliable. Next, accentuate the benefits of IaC and how changes to IT infrastructure can be implemented in a faster, safer and easier manner using IaC. Include the other benefits of IaC like applying regular unit testing and integration testing to infrastructure configurations, and maintaining up-to-date infrastructure documentation.

## How Is IaC Implemented Using AWS?
---
Start by talking about the age-old mechanisms of writing commands onto script files and testing them in a separate environment before deployment and how this approach is being replaced by IaC. Similar to the codes written for other services, with the help of AWS, IaC allows developers to write, test, and maintain infrastructure entities in a descriptive manner, using formats such as JSON or YAML. This enables easier development and faster deployment of infrastructure changes.

##  What is puppet/chef/ansible used for? What are the advantages over shell scripts ?
---

## What do you understand by `Infrastructure as code`? How does it fit into the DevOps methodology? What purpose does it achieve?
---

## How would you deploy software to 5000 systems? Do you know how you would go about large-scale deployments?
---

## Have you used Puppet, Chef, Salt or Ansible?
---
- How long have you used it for?
- Have you used it in production?

## Describe the size of the environment that you automated (how many servers,small scale or large scale)
---

## How would you assess how "deployable" a system is? How do you know when a deployment is ready?
