# Past Projects
---

How do you explain your past projects?
 
As an interviewer, I have always found a consistent pattern of struggle in this question. Most of the struggle is not having a structure to present and as a result, the rambling and long winded answers.
 
Here is an easy framework that you can use and practice if you want to give an impactful reply that showcases your real skill set:
 
IPR-CTO Framework:
 
1. Intro (I): Go top down. First give a brief of the product then the particular project you worked upon. 👋

2. Problem (P): Here you describe the feature requirement or pain point that you worked upon. 🐞

3. Role (R): Here you describe what was YOUR role in this project. e.g. front end or back end or full stack engineer or architect or tech lead or manager.

4. Contribution ( C): Here you describe what was YOUR exact contribution to this project. e.g. I wrote a design document, implemented backend APIs and unit tests using Python and Flask. Here you can ask a clarifying question to the interviewer – let me know if you’d like me to dive deep into any particular area. Also, take a pause here to ask if the interviewer has any question(s).
 
5. Timeline (T): Here you describe how long the project took to complete. ⏳
 
6. Outcome (O): Here you describe any small or big wins as a result of the delivery of this project.
 
In the end, you can also share your learnings from the project, as a matter of fact, I’d encourage you to share your learnings even if not asked.
 
If you find the acronym big, then at least go with PCO! :)
 
You have worked hard on your current and past projects, don’t miss this chance to showcase your skill set properly.
 
Godspeed. 🚀
