# Job Coding Advice
---
- Read unit tests (note that documents and people’s opinions are less reliable)
- Read others’ code submission history. You will learn a lot of skills and sometimes may connect the dots to tell an interesting story.
- No be afraid of difficult projects. Try to work with the people you admire.
- When joining a project, check if the documentations are expired. If yes, volunteer to update team documents.
