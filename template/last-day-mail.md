# Last Day Mail
---
Today is my last day (and emotional day) at <company>. I am very thankful to all my managers, collaborators, teammates, interns and other colleagues in the last four years. I was very lucky to work with colleagues across multiple orgs - <team1, team2>

Thank you all! I learned so much from you.
